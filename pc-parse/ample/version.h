 * EDIT HISTORY
 * 25-Apr-2017	SRMc - Fix for 64-bit Windows build; also remove as many
 * [3.12.20]             compiler warnings as possible
 * 24-Apr-2017  hab  - Fix bug: when a partial reduplication match pattern
 * [3.12.19]             succeeded, if the morph was not in the list of
 *                       selected morphs, a crash occured.
 * 18-May-2016  hab  - Fix bug: when a partial reduplication match pattern has
 * [3.12.18]             two instances of the same indexed class (e.g.,
 *                       [C^1][V^1][V^1]) the second one would match any member
 *                       of the class instead of the same member as the first
 *                       instance.
 * 11-Dec-2014  hab  - Fix bug: partial reduplication could use wrong
 * [3.12.17]             environment when the same allomorph was found in
 *                       an earlier path.
 * 17-Sep-2012  hab  - Fix bug: when using allomorph IDs and a record had
 * [3.12.16]             two or more morph types, the allomorph ID was lost.
 * 23-Mar-2012  hab  - Fix bug: when a partial reduplication allomorph was an
 * [3.12.15]             infix and one was tracing using SGML or XML output,
 *                       the environment shown for a failed infix location
 *                       was incorrectly calculated.
 * 10-Aug-2011  hab  - Fix bug: in a partial reduplication allomorph, if there
 * [3.12.14]             was a character between string classes, the allomorph
 *                       was never matched.  Also fix both full and partial
 *                       reduplication to work with interfixes.
 * 02-Feb-2011  hab  - Fix bug: in a partial reduplication dictionary, if the
 * [3.12.13]            string class of the allomorph does not exist,
 *                      it could cause a crash.
 * 06-Dec-2010  hab  - For partial reduplication, the members of a string class
 * [3.12.12]            need to be looked at longest first; now sort the
 *                      list by length.
 * 29-Jan-2010  hab  - For XAmple, increased size of PcPatr grammar Let names.
 * [3.12.11]
 * 30-Apr-2009  hab  - Fix bug which could cause a failure when tracing
 * [3.12.10]            while maximum prefixes was set to zero.
 * 05-Sep-2008  hab  - Rework partial reduplication to process the patterns
 * [3.12.9]             dynamically instead of generating all possible
 *                      allomorphs upon dictionary load.
 * 25-Aug-2008  hab  - Fix bug for partial reduplication for cases like
 * [3.12.8]             m[V^1][C^1] / [C][V^1][C^1] _
 * 20-Sep-2007  hab  - Check selective analysis information after extracting
 * [3.12.7]             matches from the dictionary.  When using the DLL, this
 *                      allows one to keep the loaded dictionary, but merely
 *                      change the set of selective analysis items.
 *                      (Useful for FLEx.)

 * 14-Apr-2006	hab - Fix bug which allowed a full reduplication suffix with
 * [3.12.2]             trailing segmental material to be analyzed as just
 *                      the trailing segmental material.
 * 24-Feb-2006	hab - Fix bug which caused crash while loading dictionary

 * [3.12.0]
 * 06-Jan-2006	hab - When the MaxAnalysesToReturn parameter is set, stop
 * [3.11.1]		looking for more analyses as soon as the value is
 *                      reached.  Only for XAmple.
 * 09-Dec-2005	SRMc - add "recognize only" capability for XAMPLE (-j option)
 * [3.11.0]		When set, the PC-PATR parse results are neither stored
 *                      nor written to the analysis output.  Only for XAmple.

 * [3.10.0]
 * 02-Mar-2005  hab  - Add information in tracing for when an infix allomorph

 * [3.9.2]               of <leftover> when there are null suffixes.
 * 12-Dec-2004  hab  - Add more XML output for use in FieldWorks XAmple
 * [3.9.1]               Word Grammar Debugger

 * 20-Jul-2001  hab  - Add \catcr field to xxAD.CTL file: for words which
 * [3.4.0]               consist solely of compound roots (i.e. no affixes),
 *                       it indicates whether the category of the word (i.e.
 *                       the content of the \cat field in the ANA file) should
 *                       come from the leftmost or the rightmost root in the
 *                       compound.  The field content should be either "left"
 *                       or "right".
 * 11-Jun-2001  rbr  - Fix bug in setting property type
 * [3.3.21]              (addAmpleProperty() in proper.c)
 * 31-May-2001  hab  - Fix bug which ignored RSC in processing selective
 * [3.3.20]              tracing (setAmpleSelectiveAnal() in select.c and
 *                       root_create() in setsd.c)
 * 21-May-2001  hab  - Fix bug in outputting final category whereby if using
 * [3.3.19]              suffix final and there is no suffix, an initial infix
 *                       was ignored (instead of being used).
 * 23-Apr-2001  hab  - Fix bug in parseAmpleMorphConstraint() in mccpar.c
 * [3.3.18]              which failed to free memory used by properties,
 *                       categories, category class and affix types in MCCs.
 *                     Fix bug in freeAmpleAlloEnvConstraint() in envpar.c
 *                       which failed to free memory used by punctuation
 *                       environment constraints.
 *                     Fix bug in free_entry() in setsd.c which failed to
 *                       free environment memory for root entries.
 * 17-Apr-2001  rbr  - Fix bug in resetAmpleData() in analda.c which failed
 * [3.3.17]             to free memory for any unified dictionary code table
 * 12-Dec-2000  hab  - Fix bug in mergeAmpleAmlists() in anal.c which would
 * [3.3.16]             incorrectly merge the two lists (used only by infix
 *                      processing).
 * 30-Oct-2000  hab  - Fix bug in categ.c which would crash if the Log file
 * [3.3.15]             pointer was null.
 * 24-Aug-2000  hab  - Fix bug in matchAlphaChar() which checked for
 * [3.3.14]             caseless characters after lower and upper characters;
 *                      if an a-z or A-Z character was in the list of multibyte
 *                      caseless characters, it was always treated as either
 *                      lower or upper so the special combination in the
 *                      caseless multibyte was not found.
 * 24-Jul-2000  hab  - Fix bug in XAmple which failed to copy word category
 * [3.3.13]             from dictionary when an allomorph was found
 * 26-May-2000  hab  - add concatAmpleAmlists(), mergeAmpleAmlists(),
 * [3.3.12]             getInfixEntries(), and getAllAllomorphs() in anal.c
 *                      (only used by AmpleDLL).
 * 11-May-2000	SRMc - fix portability to antique C compilers
 * [3.3.11]	     - fix in patrlib that permits XAMPLE to output all
 *			features, not just top feature or leaf node features
 * 24-Apr-2000	SRMc - more minor edits adjusting to more changes in patr.h /
 * [3.3.10]		xample
 * 19-Apr-2000	SRMc - minor adjustments to Andy's recent fixes (hardly worth
 * [3.3.9]		mentioning, but the code changed a few places)
 *		     - remove some leftover cruft from earlier versions that
 *			had been effectively commented out
 *		     - minor edits adjusting to changes in patr.h / xample
 * 10-Apr-2000  hab  - fixed bug which reported a caseless character defined
 * [3.3.8]               as a lowercase character when case was not set
 *                     fixed a minor display bug: the message of an empty
 *                      morpheme co-occurence constraint did not end in a
 *                      newline, so the following message would display at
 *                      the end of it.
 * 23-Mar-2000  hab  - fixed bug which dereferenced a null pointer when
 * [3.3.7]               protoforms are used in a root record and there are
 *                       no allomorphs
 * 14-Jan-2000  hab  - fixed bug which incorrectly calculated
 * [3.3.6]               the length of a morphname.  AMPLE would abort for
 *                       morphnames longer than 64 characters.
 * 07-Dec-1999  hab  - fixed bug which caused the check for valid MCC to not
 * [3.3.5]               take protoforms into account.
 * 03-Nov-1999  hab  - multiple root gloss error message had extra backslash.
 * [3.3.4]              Removed so message would display properly.
 * 01-Jul-1999  hab  - changed checkAmpleMorphs to have a flag to free space
 * [3.3.3]              used in morph checking or not.  The exe needs to free
 *                      the space.  The dll does not.
 * 25-May-1999  hab  - increased MAX_NUM_MORPHS and MAX_NUM_ALLOS for Ample32
 * [3.3.2]              version - were set with 512K limit in mind.
 * 18-May-1999	SRMc - fixed bug in refineAmpleAnalysis(): set pAmpleLeftHead_m
 * [3.3.1]		and pAmpleRightHead_m before calling form_anal()
 *		     - simplify the checking for null pAmpleRightHead_m and
 *			pAmpleLeftHead_m in form_anal() (probably not needed
 *			at all after the previous change)
 * 13-May-1999  hab  - add punctuation environment constraint capability
 * [3.3.0]
 * 06-May-1999  hab  - fix reference to no-longer-used bRootGlosses_g in
 * [3.2.8]              disp_allo in setsd.c (which is conditionally not
 *                      compiled usually).
 * 30-Apr-1999  hab  - changed upper range to go from codes 127 to 255
 * [3.2.7]              instead of from code 128 to 254 in spreds.l
 * 20-Apr-1999	SRMc - removed "typedef struct ample_allomorph AmpleAllomorph;"
 * [3.2.6]		from ampledef.h
 *		     - revised the replication allomorph loading to increase
 *			its speed (by about 90% or so)
 * 11-Mar-1999  hab  - remove resetLocalGlobals() and put all such globals
 * [3.2.5]              in AmpleData
 *                     fix bug which entered null root glosses when there
 *                      was no gloss in the root dictionary entry
 * 25-Feb-1999  hab  - fix another NULL pointer dereference in
 * [3.2.4]              isAmpleCategClassMember() (in categ.c)
 *                     fix bDidCatPair being set true even when field was
 *                      empty in afx_create() and ifx_create() (in setsd.c)
 *                     fix  bDidCategories being set true even when field was
 *                      empty in root_create() (in setsd.c)
 *                     fix fallacious error report of missing dictionary type
 *                      when field was final field in record; in
 *                      addAmpleDictEntry() (in setsd.c)
 *                     added initialization of infix test counters to anproc()
 *                      (in ample.c) and to AmpleParseFile() (in ampledll.c)
 *                     added final nl output to showAmpleAlloEnvConstraint()
 *                      (in setsd.c)
 *                     fix AmpleParseText() and AmpleParseFile()
 *                      (in ampledll.c) to use new surrounding words method
 *                     Added ample.rc and ampledll.rc (Win32 only) to include
 *                      version information in the exe and dll files
 * 23-Feb-1999	SRMc - fix some NULL pointer dereferences that had crept into
 * [3.2.3]		form_anal() (in anal.c)
 * 18-Nov-1998	SRMc - make the AMPLE functions fully reentrant
 * [3.2.2]	     - complain vociferously about questionable text input
 *			control file contents
 *		     - split AMPLE processing into two phases: the first looks
 *			at the word in isolation, and the second (if needed)
 *			looks as the surrounding two words
 * 24-Oct-1998	SRMc - remove direct uses of stdout
 * [3.2.1]	     - allow for '[' or ']' to be alphabetic characters
 *			(either essentially disables the reduplication code)
 *		     - add \maxprops to analysis data (control) file, and
 *			make use of >255 properties a run-time decision instead
 *			of a compile time decision
 *		     - make header files safe for #including in C++ sources
 *		     - make sure pointers are reset to NULL after AMPLE data
 *			is freed
 *		     - add capability to write tracing information to a string
 *			instead of a file
 *  1-Oct-1998	SRMc - add reduplication notation handling to allomorph fields
 * [3.2.0]		in dictionary entries

 * 18-Sep-1998  hab  - add conditional compile to allow up to 4000 properties
 * [3.1.1]              (this could go up to 65535, but is it really needed?)
