AMPLE CHANGE HISTORY

3.12.0 (06-Feb-2006)
--------------------
1. Added full reduplication capability.

3.11.1 (06-Jan-2006)
--------------------
1. When the MaxAnalysesToReturn parameter is set, stop looking for more analyses
   as soon as the value is reached.  Only for XAmple.

3.11.0 (09-Dec-2004)
-------------------
1. Add "recognize only" capability for XAMPLE (-j option).  When "true", the
   PC-PATR parse results are neither stored nor written to the analysis output.
   Only for XAmple.

3.10.0 (06-Oct-2005)
--------------------
1. Add a "compute category" capability to handle "jitterbug" category
   mappings.

3.9.4 (02-Mar-2005)
-------------------
1. Add information in tracing for when an infix allomorph matched, but its
   location failed (either the embedded morpheme type or environment(s)).

3.9.3 (09-Feb-2005)
-------------------
1. For XML output, handle special case of < in attributes.

3.9.2 (03-Feb-2005)
-------------------
1. Add XML output for maximums reached and special case of <leftover> when
   there are null suffixes.

3.9.1 (12-Dec-2004)
-------------------
1. Add more XML output (for use in FieldWorks XAmple).

3.9.0 (07-Dec-2004)
-------------------
1.  Enhancement: Added abilty to have "interfixes" (affixes which may also
	appear between roots).

  Introduction
  ------------

  These interfixes also function as either a prefix, an infix,
  or a suffix (otherwise they should just be modeled as a
  root).  The assumption being made here is that whenever one
  wants to model an affix as an interfix, one will also be
  modeling that affix as either a prefix, an infix, or a
  suffix.  Furthermore, the assumption is that one will not
  want to create a separate dictionary entry for the interfix.

  Dictionary Entries
  ------------------

  Therefore, to indicate that a given affix is also an
  interfix, one does one of the following, depending on the
  dictionary method being used:

  For "unified" dictionaries, one indicates the normal affix
  type in the entry type field followed by an indication that
  it is also an interfix.  For example, if one is using
  "\type" as the entry type field, one could use

	\type prefix nterfix
  or	\type infix nterfix
  or	\type suffix nterfix

  For non-unified dictionaries, one adds an entry type field
  code to the set of fields used by that particular dictionary
  (e.g. prefix dictionary) and then one indicates that the
  entry is also an interfix.  For example, if one is using
  "\eType" as the entry type field, one could use

	 \eType nterfix

  In both of these, note that only the first letter of the
  type word is used (this is nothing new: this field has
  always functioned this way).  Thus

	  p = prefix
	  i = infix
	  r = root
	  s = suffix
	  n = interfix

  (By the way, in unified dictionaries, if an entry does not
  contain an entry type field, that entry is assumed to be a
  root.)

  Maximums
  --------

  To use interfixes, you also will need to set the maximum
  number of interfixes to a number greater than zero.  The
  field code for this in the analysis data control file is
  \maxn.  (This new maximum has been added to CARLAStudio in
  the usual place.)

  Note that the number you use here is the maximum number of
  interfixes that may occur in a word.  This is not
  necessarily the same thing as the maximum number of
  interfixes in a row.  For example, it is conceivable that
  one could have multiple sets of interfixes:

	   prefix root interfix root interfix root suffix

  Morpheme Type and Subtype
  -------------------------

  AMPLE has the ability for the user to test the type of a
  morpheme.  One can ask if it is a root, a prefix, a suffix,
  or an infix.

  The same is true for interfixes.  One can ask if a morpheme
  is an interfix by using the key word "interfix".

  In addition, since interfixes are also another type of
  affix, one can check for the subtype of an interfix.  The
  following are available:

	  interfixprefix = a prefix that is also an interfix
	  interfixinfix  = an infix that is also an interfix
	  interfixsuffix = a suffix that is also an interfix

  One likely place where this subtype may well prove useful is
  in situations where where there are two (or more) interfixes
  between roots.  Schematically, it would look like this:

	root interfix interfix root

  Now, this only makes good sense in the following situations:

	a. When both interfixes are of the same subtype
	   (i.e. they are both also prefixes or both also
	   suffixes).

	b. When the first interfix is also a suffix and the
	   second interfix is also a prefix.

  In (b), the first interfix suffixes to the first root and
  the second interfix prefixes to the second root.

  In particular, note that what does not make good linguistic
  sense is for the first interfix to also be a prefix and for
  the second interfix to also be a suffix.  In that case, one
  has a prefix attaching to a suffix and vice versa.  See
  below for an example of a user written test that rules out
  this possibiliy.

  Interfix Successor Tests
  ------------------------

  Just like for prefixes, infixes, roots, and suffixes, one
  can use successor tests for interfixes.  The field code for
  this in the analysis data control file is \nt.  (This new
  set of tests has been added to CARLAStudio in the expected
  place.)

  One can use these to write category-oriented or
  orderclass-oriented tests as desired.

  As mentioned above, one such test one might want is the
  following:

	\nt InterfixTypeTest
		NOT (    (left    type is interfixprefix)
			 AND (current type is interfixsuffix)
		)

  This rules out the nonsensical case of a prefixal interfix
  appearing before a suffixal interfix.

  Interfix Ad-hoc Pairs
  ---------------------

  In addition, one can have interfix-oriented ad-hoc pairs
  (just like one has ad-hoc pairs for prefixes, infixes,
  roots, and suffixes).  The field code for this in the
  analysis data control file is \nah.  (This new type of
  ad-hoc pair has been added to CARLAStudio in the expected
  place.)


3.8.0 (07-Jan-2004)
-------------------
1.  Enhancement: Added negative string environment constraints to complement
	the existing string environment constraints (SECs).  NegSECs say what the
	string environment *cannot* be.  Multiple NegSECs are logically ANDed
	together.  They are indicated by "~/" (instead of SEC's "/").

3.7.5 (17-Nov-2003)
-------------------
1.  Fixed bug which caused an empty morpheme co-occurrence constraint message
	to not include any information about which entry it was for.

3.7.4 (02-Oct-2003)
-------------------
1.  Fixed bug in Xml form of trace for Allomorphs Never Co-occur Constraints
	(for XAmple only).

3.7.3 (24-Jul-2003)
-------------------
1.  Xml form of trace used wrong dtd file name

3.7.2 (23-Jul-2003)
-------------------
1.  Fixed bug which could cause SGML/XML trace output to be lost

3.7.1 (17-Jun-2003)
-------------------
1. Added SGML/XML trace output for PC-PATR grammar call

3.7.0 (12-Jun-2003)
-------------------
1. Added trace option to output in XML form (as well as SGML)

3.6.5 (17-Oct-2002)
-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

3.6.4 (16-Oct-2002)
-------------------

-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

3.6.2 (04-Oct-2002)
-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

3.6.1 (02-Oct-2002)
-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

3.6.0 (13-Jun-2002)
-------------------
1. Allow both min and max orderclass numbers (i.e. allow
   orderclasses to span a range).

3.5.0 (06-Mar-2002)
-------------------
1. Added Allomorphs Never Co-occur Constraints (for XAmple only).

3.4.1 (24-Jul-2001)
--------------------
1. Fix bug: empty environment constraint messages did not include any
   information about which entry they were for.

3.4.0 (20-Jul-2001)
-------------------
1. Add \catcr field to xxAD.CTL file: for words which consist solely of
   compound roots (i.e. no affixes).  It indicates whether the category of
   the word (i.e. the content of the \cat field in the ANA file) should
   come from the leftmost or the rightmost root in the compound.  The field
   content should be either "left" or "right".

3.3.21 (11-June-2001)
---------------------
1. Fix bug that labeled an allomorph property as a morpheme property (only evident when using -a option).

3.3.20 (31-May-2001)
--------------------
1. Fixed a bug which ignored the regular sound change (*) symbol while
   processing selective tracing.

3.3.19 (21-May-2001)
--------------------
1. Fixed a bug in outputting final category whereby if using suffix final and
   there is no suffix, an initial infix was ignored (instead of being used).

3.3.18 (23-Apr-2001)
--------------------
1. Fixed a bug which would fail to free memory used by properties, categories,
   category class and affix types in MCCs.

3.3.17 (17-Apr-2001)
--------------------
1. Fixed a bug which would fail to free memory for any unified dictionary code
   table.

3.3.16 (12-Dec-2000)
-------------------
1. Fixed a bug which could cause the wrong list of infix allomorphs to appear
   in an interactive view of allomorphs (like that used in CarlaStudio's
   QuickParse special tracing option).


3.3.15 (30-Oct-2000)
-------------------
1. Fixed a bug which caused a crash in processing categories when no log
   file was present.

3.3.14 (24-Aug-2000)
-------------------
1. Fix a bug where a multibyte caseless character beginning with either
   an a-z or an A-Z character would not allow the entire sequence to be
   treated as a word formation character.

3.3.13 (24-Jul-2000)
-------------------
1. Fix a bug in XAmple which failed to use the word category from the
   dictionary entry.

3.3.12 (26-May-2000)
-------------------
1. Some changes related to AmpleDLL.

3.3.11 (11-May-2000)
-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)
2. A bugfix for XAmple: show all features, not just leaf node features
   when all features are requested.
3. Some other changes related to XAmple.

3.3.10 (24-Apr-2000)
-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)
2. Some changes related to XAmple.

3.3.9 (19-Apr-2000)
-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)
2. Some changes related to XAmple.

3.3.8 (10-Apr-2000)
-------------------
1. Fix a bug which reported a caseless character defined as a lowercase
   character when case was not set.
2. Fix a minor display bug: the message of an empty morpheme co-occurence
   constraint did not end in a newline, so the following message would
   display at the end of it.

3.3.7 (23-Mar-2000)
-------------------
1. Fix a bug which caused AMPLE to crash when protoforms are used in a
   root record and there are no allomorphs.

3.3.6 (14-Jan-2000)
-------------------
1. Fix a bug which incorrectly calculated the length of a morphname.
   AMPLE would abort for morphnames longer than 64 characters.

3.3.5 (07-Dec-1999)
-------------------
1. Fix bug which caused the dictionary load process to ignore
   regular sound change asterisks while checking for valid
   MCCs in a dictionary entry.

3.3.4 (03-Nov-1999)
-------------------
1. Fix error message display bug in multiple root gloss
   message (it was erroneously outputting a "\t" before the
   first gloss).

3.3.3 (01-Jul-1999)
-------------------
1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

3.3.2 (25-May-1999)
-------------------
1. The Ample32 version would cease to check morphname references after
   7500 dictionary entries.  Increased it to 16,000.

3.3.1 (18-May-1999	SRMc)
-------------------
1. Fixed a bug in multi-word dependency processing.

3.3.0 (14-May-1999)
-------------------
1. Add punctuation environment constraint capability.  For example,
   Hanga indicates phonological pause orthographically by punctuation.
   Some allomorphs are conditioned at such phonological pauses.  To make
   this happen, one can add

	\pcl pausepunc . ? ! ; :

   in the AD.CTL file and then condition allomorphs something like this
   in the dictionary file:

	\s
	\a a           ./  _ [pausepunc]
	\a e    / e _  ./ ~_ [pausepunc]
	\a i    / i _  ./ ~_ [pausepunc]
	\a o    / o _  ./ ~_ [pausepunc]
	\a u    / u _  ./ ~_ [pausepunc]
	\g NCMPT
	\c Noun

   This means that the "a" allomorph occurs before a pausepunc
   character; the "e" allomorph must follow an "e" and cannot occur
   before a pausepunc character; etc.

   There is a new built-in test called PEC_ST which handles these
   punctuation environment constraints.

   The user can also write a user-written test with a clause such as
	next punctuation is "."
   or
	next punctuation is member [pausepunc]


3.2.7 (30-Apr-1999)
-------------------
1. User-written tests will now allow use of codes 127 and 255.  They
   used to produce error messages.


3.2.6 (20-Apr-1999)
-------------------

1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

2. Revised the replication allomorph loading to increase its speed
   (by about 90% or so).


3.2.5 (11-Mar-1999)
-------------------

1. Some minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

2. Fix bug which entered null root glosses when there was no gloss in
   the root dictionary entry.

3.2.4 (25-Feb-1999)
-------------------
1. Fix another NULL pointer dereference bug.

2. Fix some dictionary loading bugs

3. Fix fallacious error report of missing dictionary type when field
   was final field in record.

4. Add final nl output to showAmpleAlloEnvConstraint().

5. Fix AmpleParseText() and AmpleParseFile() (in ampledll.c) to use
   new surrounding words method.

6. Added ample.rc and ampledll.rc (Win32 only) to include version
   information in the exe and dll files.


3.2.3 (23-Feb-1999)
-------------------
1. Fix some NULL pointer dereference bugs.


3.2.2 (18-Nov-1998)
-------------------
1. Make the AMPLE functions fully reentrant.

2. Complain vociferously about questionable text input control file
   contents.

3. Split AMPLE processing into two phases: the first looks at the word
   in isolation, and the second (if needed) looks as the surrounding two
   words.


3.2.1 (24-Oct-1998)
-------------------
1. Remove direct uses of stdout.

2. Allow for '[' or ']' to be alphabetic characters
   (either essentially disables the reduplication code).

3. Add \maxprops to analysis data (control) file, and make use of >255
   properties a run-time decision instead of a compile time decision.

4. minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)

5. Add capability to write tracing information to a string instead of a file.


3.2.0 (1-Oct-1998)
------------------
1. Add reduplication notation handling to allomorph fields in
   dictionary entries.


3.1.2 (24-Sep-1998)
------------------
1. Enhance error reports in parsing of morph constraints to include
   the record identifier.


3.1.1 (18-Sep-1998)
-------------------
1. Add conditional compile to allow up to 4000 properties.


3.1.0 (14-Jul-98)
-----------------
1. Add \luwfcs and \wfcs fields to the text input control file for
   multibyte character handling in decapitalization.


3.0.7 (18-Mar-98)
-----------------
1. minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)


3.0.6 (11-Mar-98)
-----------------
1. Fix a bug in checking for valid MCCs in loading dictionary entries.


3.0.5 (20-Feb-98)
-----------------
1. minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)


3.0.4 (17-Feb-98)
-----------------
1. Fix a bug in handling errors while loading dictionary code tables.

2. Change loading of dictionary code tables to detect unified
   dictionaries automatically.

3. Fix a bug in handling the -v command line option.

4. Give up on errors loading control files rather than trying to get
   another filename.


3.0.3 (11-Feb-98)
-----------------
1. Fix a bug in SGML tracing of final test failures.

2. Try to fix a bug (misfeature?) in Windows DLL interface.

3. Change parsing to look for infixes only in the first root of compound
   roots.


3.0.2 (23-Dec-97)
-----------------
1. minor internal code changes (nothing visible to the user)


3.0.1 (22-Dec-97)
-----------------
1. Fix a bug in setting the "Surface Form" of an analyzed word.

2. Fix a long-standing bug in test evaluation reported by Andy Black:
   adjacent word references were not always checking for the existence of
   an adjacent word.


3.0.0 (21-Oct-97)
-----------------
Decide that this is a release, no longer a beta!


3.0b13 (15-Oct-97)
------------------
1. {ID} labels were added to the Morpheme Co-occurrence Constraint
   syntax.

2. The -q (work quietly) command line option was added.

3. Various bugs were fixed, and other internal improvements were made.


3.0b12 (14-Aug-97)
------------------
1. Progress reporting was changed to use '*' for analysis failures and
   '>' for 10 or more ambiguous results.

2. Tracing was changed to allow SGML style output, using the
   AmpleTrc.DTD specification developed by Andy Black.


3.0b11 (13-Jun-97)
------------------
1. "noload" ('!') record fields are now handled properly.

2. The allomorph ID is written to the parse trace output if it exists.

3. Selective tracing is now handled by setting a flag bit rather than
   by selectively storing the allomorph.  This is for the benefit of
   interactive applications, which may want to change the set of
   selected morphnames (or allomorphs) on the fly.

4. There are numerous internal changes that should not be visible to
   the user.


3.0b10 (8-May-97)
-----------------
1. Morpheme co-occurrence constraints loaded from the dictionary are
   now stored with each morpheme rather than in a single list with
   those loaded from the analysis data file.  This allows the
   dictionary to be written to a file without losing information.  The
   morpheme co-occurrence constraints are checked to verify that they
   apply only to the morpheme whose entry they appear in.

2. The writeAmpleDictionary() function now uses "AmpleLinks Canonical
   Format" markers, and the updateAmpleDictEntry() function now uses
   "AmpleLinks Canonical Format" markers by default.


3.0b9 (30-Apr-97)
-----------------
1. Several changes were made to support the LinguaLinks (Microsoft
   Windows) DLL:
	* the writeAmpleDictionary() and updateAmpleDictEntry() functions
	  were written;
	* allomorph identifiers were added to the allomorph fields in the
	  AMPLE dictionaries; and
	* the -b command line option was added to enable storing allomorph
	  identifiers in memory.

2. The data structures were modified to allow multiple sets of AMPLE
   data to be loaded at once.  (Neither the program nor the LinguaLinks
   DLL actually use this capability.)


3.0b8 (4-Apr-97)
----------------
1. The output of the original word field (\w) was made properly optional.

2. The surface form field (\s) was removed, since it is redundant with the
   morpheme decomposition field (\d).

3. An invalid use of the {group} construct in allomorph string environment
   constraints is now detected.

4. An online AMPLE Reference Manual is now distributed with the program.

5. The -x (eXclude) and -w (Write) command line options were added.  See
   the AMPLE Reference Manual for details about these options, which
   control the output of certain fields (\d, \p, \w).


3.0b7 (4-Mar-97)
----------------
1. Some internal data structures were changed (nothing visible to users).


3.0b6 (20-Feb-97)
-----------------
1. The output for analysis failures was fixed to work properly with the
   older versions of intergen and ambex.

2. Entries in unified dictionaries are now allowed to have more than
   one type.  (See version 3.0b1 below for a description of unified
   dictionaries.)  The different types must be separated by spaces or
   tabs.


3.0b5 (14-Feb-97)
-----------------
1. Several memory allocation bugs were fixed.

2. Multiple category fields in affix dictionary entries are now allowed
   since root dictionaries allow this; there was no good reason to have
   this difference.

3. Dictionary entries are checked for having only one occurrence of
   fields that should occur only once.  For each redundant field that
   should not exist, an error message is written to the log file, and
   the field contents are ignored.  This changes the program behavior:
   the last redundant version of such fields was used without warning.


3.0b4 (31-Jan-97)
-----------------
1. Some portability issues were addressed in the code (nothing visible
   to users).


3.0b3 ( 9-Dec-96)
-----------------
1. Decapitalization was fixed to handle ambiguous situations.  This
   addressed a longstanding deficiency in the code.

2. A "surface form" field (\s) was added to the analysis output.  The
   original word (\w) field now truly contains the original word,
   capitalization and all.  The surface form field contains the word
   after decapitalization and orthography changes.  It is ambiguous
   only if decapitalization produces multiple forms, and more than one
   of those forms produces an analysis.


3.0b2 (25-Nov-96)
-----------------
1. A bug in capitalization of words with a single upper/lowercase
   letter was fixed.  (This bug was introduced in version 3.0b1.)


3.0b1 ( 7-Nov-96)
-----------------
AMPLE 3.0b1 represents a major revision of the internal code structure
and organization; thus the change in major version number.  (I would
have preferred to change from version 1 to version 2, but that was
already done for minor revisions a year earlier.)  The user-visible
changes should be limited to the following:

1. A new -u command line option signals that the dictionary has been
   "unified" into a single file (or set of files) rather than splitting
   it into parts based on morpheme type (prefix, infix, suffix, root).
   This affects both the dictionary files and the dictionary code table
   file (xxANCD.TAB).  The dictionary code table file has a new field:
   \unified which is equivalent to \prefix, \infix, \suffix, or \root.
   As with the other fields, \unified has the unique record marker as
   an argument following it on the line.  The set of changes for
   dictionary entry field codes follows it as with the other fields.
   One more "gate" has been added.  The field code for telling the type
   of the entry must be changed to "T" (capital T).  For example, the
   dictionary codes table could look like this for a unified dictionary:

	\unified \mid
	\ch "\type" "T"
	\ch "\a"    "A"
	\ch "\c"    "C"
	\ch "\ge"   "M"
	\ch "\lx"   "E"
	\ch "\mp"   "P"
	\ch "\o"    "O"
	\ch "\mcc"  "Z"
	\ch "\f"    "F"
	\ch "\no"   "!"

   In the dictionary, the type of an entry is determined by the first
   letter following the type field code: "p" or "P" for prefixes, "i"
   or "I" for infixes, "s" or "S" for suffixes, and "r" or "R" for
   roots.  The type field is not needed for root entries because the
   entry type defaults to root.

   This change was motivated by requests from a couple of individuals,
   from the viewpoint of using either Shoebox or LinguaLinks to
   maintain dictionaries for AMPLE.

2. The environment constraints for orthography changes are limited to
   the word itself: they cannot access adjacent words.

   This change was caused by using a common orthography change function
   shared by several other programs such as PRIMER and KTEXT.

3. Tracing messages, warnings, and other messages that go the "standard
   output" are written only if the standard output is redirected to a
   file.  Internally, these are written to the "log file", but only if
   a log file has been opened.  Currently, the log file is opened by
   redirecting the standard output:
				ample ... >file.log

   This change was motivated by the process of deriving a function
   library from AMPLE that allows the morphological parser to be used
   in different contexts than the AMPLE program itself.  Consider the
   issue of using the AMPLE parser inside a Windows or Macintosh
   program that lacks the MS-DOS (and UNIX) concept of "standard
   output".

4. A greater number of ambiguous parses may be produced.  Earlier
   versions of AMPLE checked only the \a (analysis) field for being
   unique.  Version 3.0b1 checks all fields that are being written to
   the output file.  If only the \a field is written, then the results
   should be the same.

5. The order of ambiguous parses may be different even when the same
   set of parses is produced.  This has no logical effect, but makes
   comparing .ANA files more difficult.  To address this, a new utility
   program ANADIFF.EXE has been written.

6. The MS-DOS AMPLE program compiled for 386 processors works much
   better with Windows than previous 386 versions.  There should be no
   problem running it under Windows.

=============================================================================

2.0b Sep 95 fixes a bug in the 386 version of 1.9zc property output.

2.0a Sep 95 changes the 1.9y fix to require nl only after \id.

2.0 Sep 95 fixes a bug in 1.9zc property output.

1.9zc Aug 95 adds the ability to output properties. They are
output with a \p marker, and use an equal sign separator like
features. The purpose of this enhancement is to allow Sentrans
rules to refer to properties.

1.9zb Jun 95 adds the ability to distinguish upper case input
words from lower case words in tests. This allows better
disambiguation of lexically capitalized words. For example 'God'
can be distinguished from 'god'. It also allows tests to
correctly account for orthographies in which tone marks are left
off of upper case letters.

The following is added to the user test syntax:

	<factor> ::= <cap-expr>

	<cap-expr> ::= <pos> allomorph is capitalized
				   word is capitalized

This allows writing tests of the form:

\ft CAP_FT
	IF ( current allomorph is capitalized
	   AND current type is initial )
	THEN word is capitalized

This test says that if the first morpheme in the word is
capitalized in the dictionary, then the word must be
capitalized. This test must be written as a final test
instead of a successor test because successor tests are not
performed on the initial morpheme.

A related enhancement is that AMPLE now applies the same
case lowering code to dictionary allomorphs as is applied
to input text. The result is that the list of orthography
changes to convert the letters A-Z to a-z is no longer
required, and in fact should not be used, as it defeats the
ability of AMPLE to detect upper case in the dictionary.

This case lowering is applied only to the first alphabetic
character of each dictionary allomorph, on the assumption that
there is no reason to use all caps in the dictionary.

Case lowering of dictionary entries is enabled by the new
marker \dicdecap in the Analysis Data Control file. This was
done for upward compatibility on data sets that change lower
case letters to upper case in the Input Text Control file.

If \dicdecap is not used, then user tests that refer to
capitalization are unable to see the capitalization.

Another effect of this enhancement is that synthesis of lexically
capitalized words now works correctly. If an allomorph of a
dictionary entry is capitalized, the STAMP program outputs
it capitalized. This handles words like 'naJesus' changing
to 'nJesus' correctly, where the previous approach which
only remembered that the third letter was capitalized failed.

Because lexical capitalization is now handled correctly, AMPLE
no longer outputs information about internal capitalization
of individual letters. It only notes first cap or all caps.

1.9za Jun 95 adds better error reporting for user tests in
zzSTAMP.DEC

1.9z May 95 adds improved string checking. A \strcheck field was
added to the ??AD01.CTL file and should contain a list of
characters considered valid for allomorphs, string environments
and string classes.

1.9y May 95 fixes poor handling of ignore fields in the input
file. Instead of terminating the ignore field at the first
backslash encountered, AMPLE now terminates ignore fields only
when it encounters a newline backslash.

1.9x May 95 adds better error reporting for MCC's without an
environment.

1.9w Apr 95 modifies curly brace and square bracket behavior in
morpheme environments.  Curly braces: Look first for category or
property but accept morpheme class.  Brackets: Look first for
morpheme class but accept a category or property.

1.9v Apr 95 fixes a bug that caused an MEC containing an ellipses
and attempting to look at a neighboring word, to evaluate
incorrectly.

1.9u Apr 95 removes reporting of ambiguous words percentages by
default but allows you to turn this reporting on by specifying
the -p option on the command line.

1.9t Apr 95 fixes a problem concerning error/warning messages
output for dictionary entries with a blank key field. Instead of
outputting nothing as a record identifier, the record number is
output instead.

1.9r Feb 95 fixes a bug in the 386 version of AMPLE that caused
the program to crash and display a cryptic error message with
several lines of register values, etc. detailing the crash.

1.9p Nov 94 fixes a bug in which selective trace would not find a
morpheme which had space before it at the beginning of a line in
the selective trace file.

1.9m May 94 adds the capability in MECs and MCCs of looking at
the morpheme environments of neighboring words.  This capability
is limited to one word on each side of the word under analysis.

1.9k Mar 94 adds an underlying form capability as desribed below.

Many linguistic theories posit "basic" or "underlying" forms for
morphemes.  When producing interlinear texts, some linguists
prefer using such basic or underlying forms for the morphemes.
Until now, AMPLE has only allowed for a morpheme decomposition
that consists of the characters of the actual "surface" form.
This information is included in the \d field of the analysis
output file.  For example, consider the following entry from the
analysis output file for a word from Chichicapan Zapotec.

	\a C AF < V2 throw >
	\d p-a-:ka'h
	\w baca'h

The original word is "baca'h" which has been mapped via
orthography changes to "pa:ka'h".  This has been decomposed
into the sequence "p-a-:ka'h" which corresponds to the
Completive and Actor Focus prefixes followed by the verb
root meaning "to throw".  The "p" and "a" allomorphs of the
Completive and Actor Focus morphemes are not the basic or
underlying forms for these morphemes.  The underlying forms
are "kw" and "u", respectively.

Beginning with version 1.9k, there is a way to have AMPLE
produce basic or underlying forms as well as the morpheme
decomposition.  In the example above, the output can now
become as follows.

	\a C AF < V2 throw >
	\d p-a-:ka'h
	\u kw-u-:ka'h
	\w baca'h

The additional \u field contains the correct basic or
underlying forms.  These are separated by the decomposition
character just as in the \d field.  Beginning with version
??.?? of the INTERGEN program, one can use INTERGEN to
produce interlinear text that contains the underlying forms.

To include underlying forms in the output, one must add a
change in the dictionary code table to map a field to the
"U" gate.  This should be done for every dictionary type
used (i.e. prefix and/or infix and/or suffix and root).  For
example, if one wishes to use \uf as the underlying form
field, then one must add a line such as the following to
each entry in the dictionary code table:

  \ch "\uf"  "U"    | Underlying form

This "U" gate must be present in the dictionary code table
for AMPLE to include a \u field in the analysis output file
record.  If there are not any "U" gates in the dictionary
code table, then AMPLE will not produce the \u field in the
analysis output file.

Naturally, it is important that if one dictionary type
employs a "U" gate, then all of the dictionaries should have
a "U" gate.  AMPLE will check for such consistency and will
give an error message if it detects that some dictionaries
have a "U" gate while another does not.  The message is of
the form:

DICTIONARY CODE TABLE: missing "U" gate in <dict> record

where <dict> will be "prefix", "infix", "suffix", or "root".

If a particular record in a dictionary file does not have
an underlying form field, but does use an "elsewhere" field,
then AMPLE will use the elsewhere entry for the underlying
form.  (The "elsewhere" field uses the "E" gate.)  If there
is neither an underlying form field nor an elsewhere field
in an entry, AMPLE will assume that the underlying form is
null and will output a zero (0) for that entry.

1.9h Feb 94 fixes a bug described as follows:

If one had a feature field in a dictionary entry of the form
shown below in (1), then the whitespace before the final
comment bar was included in the feature definition (i.e. in
the .ana file the feature field looked like the one in (2)
below).

(1)  \r na
	 \a na
	 \c Prt
	 \ge rep            | repetitive
	 \f na
	 |\tone right-floating h @ tbu 1    | 9402.09 John Daly recalls that rep
										|         does not have a register h

(2) \a %2%< Prt rep >%< Prt prox >%
	\d %2%na%na%
	\fd %2%na                           %na`%
	\w nﬂ

1.9g Dec 93 collapses identical root allomorph environments
to make more dictionary space.

1.9f Dec 93 saves code space by using string list data
structures, rather than the equivalent property list and category
list data structures, to build lists of property sets and
category sets.

1.9f also saves dictionary space by storing only one copy
of each unique category list.

1.9f also adds double quotes into messages where
appropriate, such as the following message:

	 Unknown morphname "not" in morpheme class: Neg

1.9f also removes the permanent heap.

1.9f also adds code to check for non-wordforming characters
in string environments.

1.9f also fixes a bug in which AMPLE didn't recognize
a standard format marker occurring at the end of a line in
the input text file.  As trailing punctuation to the word
preceding the format marker, AMPLE would put out two
backslashes.  Then the actual marker itself (excluding the
backslash) would be interpreted as the next word, which of
course would fail to analyze unless it happened to coincide
with a dictionary entry.  The repaired AMPLE recognizes the
format marker and puts it out as formatting material
preceding the next word.

1.9f also fixes a bug in which the preceding word in a
string environment was not recognized under some circumstances.

1.9f also avoids an infinite loop of "RECORD IS TOO BIG"
messages in the log file.

1.9 May 93 was put onto distribution disks in May 93.
