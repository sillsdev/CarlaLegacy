/****************************************************************************
 * EDIT HISTORY
 * 25-Apr-2017	SRMc - Fix for 64-bit Windows build; also remove as many
 * [2.2.1]             compiler warnings as possible
 * 03-Dec-2004	hab  - Allow for interfixes
 * [2.2.0]
 * 16-Oct-2002	SRMc - fix for code generation problem in OPAC library
 * [2.1b16]
 * 15-Oct-2002	SRMc - facilitate checking memory allocation
 * [2.1b15]
 *  4-Oct-2002	SRMc - fix bugs found by evaluating Insure++
 * [2.1b14]
 *  2-Oct-2002	SRMc - Handle underlying forms missing from the analysis file
 * [2.1b13]		better, without spurious output lines for analysis
 *			failures, and without crashing the program.
 * 23-Jul-2001  hab  - If the \w field is being used, there is no need to apply
 * [2.1.b12]            output changes or to try to recapitalize: the content
 *                      of the \w field already has these.
 * 26-Oct-2000  hab  - If the first word is a failure, then the underlying form
 * [2.1.b11]            field was not displayed, resulting in the next word's
 *                      \u content to appear under the first word.
 * 11-May-2000	SRMc - fix portability to antique C compilers
 * [2.1b10]
 * 17-Apr-2000	SRMc - use strncat properly - the third argument is the maximum
 * [2.1b9]		number of non-NUL characters that can be appended, NOT
 *			the total size of the destination buffer
 *  2-Sep-1999	SRMc - bumped patch level for new release (revised OPAC
 * [2.1b8]		library functions)
 * 19-May-1999  hab  - fix erroneous reporting of \c as missing instead of \cat
 * [2.1b7]
 * 09-Apr-1999  hab  - fix so multibyte characters are treated as counting
 * [2.1b6]              only one character (not 2 or however long it is)
 * 31-Jul-98	SRMc - fix for multibyte character handling by the TextControl
 * [2.1b5]		data structure and related functions
 * 18-May-98	SRMc - replace call to gets() with fgets(), as generally
 * [2.1b4]		recommended
 * 11-May-98    hab  - Changed default feature standard format field to \\fea.
 * [2.01b3]            Fixed erroneous usage() output and error message in
 *                     determineFieldCode().
 * 06-May-98    hab  - Fixed spurious output bug when a requested field
 * [2.01b2]            was not in the input file.
 *                     In usage(), add a pause message after about 20 lines.
 * 28-Apr-98    hab  - Added -f switch to output backslash codes at the
 * [2.01b1]            beginning of each output line.
 *                     Fixed monitoring to not display a failure for the final
 *                     "non-word word" (which exists when there are trailing
 *                     format markers.
 * 06-Apr-98    hab  - Fixed bug with monitoring that displayed a failure as
 *                     an analysis.
 * 31-Mar-98    hab  - Add ability to output any field in the ANA file and to
 *                     output them in any order.  Added command line option
 *                     -s for the user to indicate which fields and in what
 *                     order to output.  Default remains as before: decomp,
 *                     underlying form (if present) and analysis.  A field
 *                     may be output more than once if so desired.
 *                   - Add check for a maximum line length that is longer than
 *                     the internal buffer size.
 *                   - Remove check for existence of output file
 *                   - Added -m monitor progress option
 *                   - Added -q quiet mode option
 *                   - Added -e show every decomposition ambiguity option
 *                   - Fixed a bug which would output a set of blank lines
 *                     whenever there was nothing on the current line and
 *                     the next word to be added was larger than the max line
 *                     length.  This is a very old bug.
 * 20-Mar-98	SRMc - fix for new OPAC and CPORT libraries (this eliminates
 * [1.99b1]		all source files except INTERGEN.C itself)
 *		     - split the version information and history into a
 *			separate header file

 *			  -o output, -t Text output control file
