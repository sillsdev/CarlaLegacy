 * EDIT HISTORY
 * 25-Apr-2017	SRMc - Fix for 64-bit Windows build; also remove as many
 * [1.4.5]             compiler warnings as possible
 * 29-Jan-2010	hab  - increase size of Let template name from 80 to 300.
 * [1.4.4]		Some FLEx users need more than 80 characters.
 *  9-Nov-2006	SRMc - fixed bug in constraint processing: yet another final
 * [1.4.3]		pass over the parse trees to "triple check" the
 *			constraints
 * 18-Jul-2006	hab  - in XML output, add sentence number to id (makes the
 * [1.4.2]              id unique within the file for all sentences)
 * 7-Jul-2006	hab  - Moved PumpMessages()( to opaclib
 * [1.4.1]
 * 07-Dec-2005	SRMc - add "recognize only" capability
 * [1.4.0]
 * 26-Sep-2005  hab  - In XML tree dump, either output all features if
 * [1.3.12]             "set features on" and "set features all" are set or
 *                      output no features if "set features off" is set.
 * 21-Sep-2005  hab  - In XML tree dump, fix underlyingform info to use the
 * [1.3.11]             decomposition separation character in the input word
 *                      section.
 * 26-Aug-2005  hab  - In XML tree dump, if the input was an ANA file, also
 * [1.3.10]             output the input word and its (disambiguated) analyses
 * 06-Dec-2004  hab  - Allow for interfixes in Ample ANA (i.e. handle more than
 * [1.3.9]              one set of roots)
 * 11-Dec-2002  hab  - fix bug in doublecheck_constraints(): only need to double
 * [1.3.8]              check logical constraints for mother nodes within a
 *                      production;  these are the only ones where the feature
 *                      might change
 * 25-Oct-2002	SRMc - portability fix in cmd library
 * [1.3.7]
 * 17-Oct-2002  hab  - add init change for change in ample data struct
 * [1.3.6]
 * 16-Oct-2002	SRMc - fix for code generation problem in OPAC library
 * [1.3.5]
 * 15-Oct-2002	SRMc - fix bugs introduced earlier
 * [1.3.4]	     - fix some memory leaks
 *  4-Oct-2002	SRMc - fix bugs found by Insure++ evaluation.
 * [1.3.3]
 *  2-Oct-2002	SRMc - make readToken() and buildPATRFeatureDisjunction() safe
 * [1.3.2]		for 8-bit characters.
 * 20-Jun-2002  hab  - added disphead.h so that pckimmo, etc. that use patr.h
 * [1.3.1]              do not have conflict with new display_header()
 * 07-Mar-2002  hab  - add rootgloss feature capability (hab130)
 * [1.3.0]             add indexed variables to logical constraints (hab130v)
 *                     redid display_header() to have an argument and made it
 *                      so that the DLL will output the header info (hab130l)
 *                      display_header is now in disphead.c
 * 27-Sep-2001	SRMc - add doublecheck_constraints() function to perform a
 * [1.2.12]		final pass through a parse tree to verify that all
 *			logical constraints are still satisfied in the final
 *			result.
 * 20-Sep-2001  hab  - change failure message from "Cannot parse" to
 * [1.2.11]             "Not able to parse" so will not erroneously give a
 *                      warning in CarlaStudio.  Yes, this is a hack...
 * 08-Aug-2001  hab  - fix bug which would not report number of edges in Ample
 * [1.2.10]             ANA file output in \failure line.
 * 15-Jun-2001  hab  - fix bug which would not always show gloss lines in
 * [1.2.9]              trees in ana files when failures were on.
 *              hab  - Put sentence statistics in log file not in ANA file
 *                       when doing PatrParser::DisambiguateAnaFile()
 * 22-May-2001	SRMc - fix bug in applyPATRPriorityUnion() which kept the union
 * [1.2.8]		from working if the input feature did not have the
 *			feature path it was supposed to union with.
 *                    - add check for NULL category feature name before storing
 *        		the grammar in memory.
 *		     - add check for edge nesting depth < 1000 at the point
 *			where we (conditionally) check for cycles
 * 21-May-2001  hab  - fix a bug that would stop reading an ANA file as soon
 * [1.2.7]              as it encountered an ANA failure.  (The problem was
 *                      in senttemp.c in opaclib)
 * 30-Apr-2001  hab  - fix a bug that did not increment sentence count in
 * [1.2.6]              PatrParser::DisambiguateAnaFile()
 * 17-Apr-2001  hab  - fix a bug that had "</f>" instead of "</F>".
 * [1.2.5]             change colons in ids to periods.  Some XML validators
 *                      do not accept colon in ids.
 * 11-Apr-2001  hab  - change XML output to not include header, to use
 * [1.2.4]              initial upper case element names (e.g. "Parse"
 *                      instead of "parse" and "Analysis" instead of
 *                      "analysis").
 * 11-May-2000	SRMc - the "bug" in handling default categories needs to be
 * [1.2.3]		fixed for FILE DISAMBIGUATE as well as for FILE PARSE
 *		     - fix bug in feature display that caused only leaf nodes
 *			in the parse tree to have their features displayed in
 *			XAMPLE output
 *		     - allow empty feature as the target of operations in
 *			lexical rules
 *		     - handle "unify" and "replace" operations differently in
 *			lexical rules
 *		     - remove a couple of unused static functions from
 *			patrlexi.c
 *		     - fixed some memory allocation errors
 * 24-Apr-2000	SRMc - change SENTENCE-FINAL-PUNCTUATION to FINAL-PUNCTUATION
 * [1.2.2]	     - fix the PatrParser::PatrParser constructor to handle
 *			the changes to PATRData properly
 *		     - fix a bizarre bug in dlltest/WinPatrTest.frm that was
 *			crashing when trying to initialize some Boolean
 *			properties
 *		     - add the ANA \d, \u, \fd, and \p (decomposition,
 *			underlying form, feature descriptor, and property)
 *			verbatim field contents to the feature structure of
 *			words acquired from AMPLE analysis.  \fd and \p fields
 *			that are essentially empty are not added to the feature
 *			structure.
 *		     - optionally use the property names in the ANA \p field
 *			as feature template references
 *		     - add the SET PROPERTY-IS-FEATURE command
 *		     - add the AmplePropertyIsFeature property to the
 *			IPatrParser COM interface
 * 18-Apr-2000	SRMc - fix some minor glitches in debug output
 * [1.2.1]	     - use strncat properly - the third argument is the maximum
 *			number of non-NUL characters that can be appended, NOT
 *			the total size of the destination buffer
 *		     - use DynString instead of a fixed buffer for building an
 *			output display
 *		     - dynamically allocate the array of nonterminal names in
 *			PATRRule, and the array of PATRVertex structures in
 *			PATRParseData
 *		     - rename get_ample_roots() to get_ample_morphnames() in
 *			patrampl.c, and fix "bug" that was omitting prefixes
 *			(according to the previous name, the real bug was
 *			including suffixes)
 *		     - fix bug in lcparse.c/extend_lc_edge (fix in 1.1.3
 *			deferred the NULL pointer dereference to later in the
 *			function)
 *		     - allow basic keywords in the grammar file to begin with a
 *			backslash (for example, either rule or \rule is
 *			permitted).  This allows easier interoperation with
 *			Shoebox.
 *		     - added COMMENT keyword to the grammar file parsing, along
 *			with \comment and \co as aliases
 *		     - add the SET SENTENCE-FINAL-PUNCTUATION command
 *		     - add the SentenceFinalPunctuation property to the
 *			IPatrParser COM interface and the
 *		     - fix a "bug" in handling default categories: an explicit
 *			default category imposed by a template ("Let A be !B")
 *			now overrides the implicit default category provided by
 *			the category field of an entry in the lexicon ("\c A")
 * 27-Jan-2000	SRMc - add the SET PROMOTE-DEFAULTS command
 * [1.2.0]	     - add the SET KIMMO PROMOTE-DEFAULTS command
 *		     - add the SET KIMMO CHECK-CYCLES command
 *		     - add the SET KIMMO TOP-DOWN-FILTER command
 *		     - get -q ("Work quietly") to work even more quietly
 * 22-Jan-2000	SRMc - add the rule id string (if available) to the XML output
 * [1.1.4]		of parse nodes
 *		     - change the DLL/COM interface to allow splitting the
 *			lexicon into multiple files
 *		     - add a property to the DLL/COM interface to retrieve the
 *			number of files currently loaded into the in-memory
 *			lexicon
 *		     - add a method to the DLL/COM interface to load AMPLE
 *			Analysis (.ana) files into the in-memory lexicon
 *		     - add a method to the DLL/COM interface to reload the
 *			current set of lexicon files
 *		     - plug a few memory leaks (mostly in the DLL)
 *  6-Dec-1999	SRMc - fix two bugs reported by Benjamin Redelings I
 * [1.1.3]		(bredelin@ucla.edu):
 *			1. buffer overrun in userpatr.c/print_treenode()
 *			2. NULL ptr dereference in lcparse.c/extend_lc_edge()
 *  2-Dec-1999	SRMc - minor fixes to debug output
 * [1.1.2]	     - write summary statistics to log file as well as stderr
 *		     - fix bug in numbering sentences in FILE DISAMBIGUATE
 *			output
 *		     - don't count parses twice in handling the FILE
 *			DISAMBIGUATE command
 *		     - add a method to the DLL/COM interface to implement the
 *			"disambiguate AMPLE Analysis (.ana) file" functionality
 *		     - add a property to the DLL/COM interface to flag whether
 *			or not to write syntactic parses to disambiguated
 *			AMPLE Analysis (.ana) files
 * 22-Sep-1999	SRMc - change XML output to use leading _ (underscore) instead
 * [1.1.1]		of a leading : (colon) in ID attributes.  The XML
 *			parser used by Visual Basic does not handle colons in
 *			ID strings even though the XML standard explicitly
 *			allows them.
 *  2-Sep-1999	SRMc - added SET TREE XML command, and XML file output
 * [1.1.0]	     - added XML string output, and fixed string output for
 *			the other formats (for use by DLLs)
 *		     - bFailure and bUnification no longer propagate from the
 *			syntax (PC-PATR) to the morphological (Kimmo) level
 *		     - extensive internal changes to reduce the number of
 *			static (global) variables to a minimum, in order to
 *			allow multiple PATR grammars to exist simultaneously,
 *			beyond the syntax level / embedded morphological level
 *			already allowed
 *		     - major revision to output functions to handle coindexing
 *			properly for each individual parse.  (This has been
 *			asked for many times, and I finally figured out how to
 *			do it: it requires more memory and processing time,
 *			but not too awful much so.)
 *		     - show both original (lexicon) feature and the output
 *			(unified) feature for leaf nodes of the tree.  (This
 *			was requested by Andy and Cheri Black, and might be
 *			user-controllable in the future.)
 *		     - added SET LIMIT <number> command
 *		     - change FILE DISAMBIGUATE output to match "normal"
 *			output as much as possible
 *		     - change failed parse feature output to use the values
 *			attached to the chart edges rather than the (new)
 *			unified parse features
 *		     - create a DLL/COM interface to the PC-PATR parser

 * [0.99b13]
 * 24-Sep-1998	SRMc - added the "Constraint xx is ..." statement to the
 * [0.99b12]		grammar file definition, and fixed rule constraint
 *			expressions to use defined constraints instead of
 *			(in addition to) verbatim constraints
 *		     - fix bugs in tokenizing for constraint expressions
 *		     - fix handling of lexical rules to produce multiple
 *			output features when adding lexical items to the
 *			parse chart
 * 18-Sep-1998	SRMc - defined the PATRPriorityUnion data structure, together
 * [0.99b11]		with related functions
