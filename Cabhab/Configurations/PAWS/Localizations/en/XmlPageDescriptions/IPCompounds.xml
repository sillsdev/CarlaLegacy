    <title level="2">Basic Sentences - Verb Compounds</title>
    <introduction>Verbs may combine with other verbs, or with nouns or other word categories to form verb compounds.  These compounds still act like verbs, though they may have changed their subcategorization, such as from a transitive verb to an intransitive verb. <br/><br/>
    Besides compounds which are written as a single word, there are also idiomatic expressions consisting of a verb and another word.  Examples of some of the most common types will be collected here, beginning with the true verb compounds.</introduction>
