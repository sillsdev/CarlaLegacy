	<title level="2">Questions - Interrogative Phrases</title>
   <introduction>Content questions differ from Yes/No questions in that they contain an interrogative word or phrase, known as <i>wh</i>-phrases in English because they almost all begin with <example>wh</example> (<example>who(m)</example>, <example>what</example>, <example>why</example>, <example>where</example>, <example>when</example>, <example>how</example>, <example>how many</example>, <example>which</example>, <example>whose</example>).  In some languages, some or all of these interrogatives are expressed as affixes.</introduction>
    <form section="q">
<prompt>For all of the following text boxes, if your language expresses that interrogative via an affix, enter it in the box with a hyphen on the appropriate side to indicate whether it is a prefix or a suffix.  Each word, phrase or affix should be entered on a separate line.</prompt>

        <br/>
		<introduction>Of the examples of interrogative words above, most simply stand alone as pronouns or adverbs, but <example>how</example> can either be a manner adverb by itself or a degree word modifying an adjective, as in <example>how big</example>; <example>what</example> can either be a pronoun by itself or a demonstrative modifying a noun, as in <example>what books</example>; <example>which</example> never stands alone but always modifies a noun as a demonstrative, as in <example>which boy</example>; <example>how many / how much</example> is a quantifier, as in <example>how many children</example> or <example>how much money</example>; and <example>whose</example> can be either a stand alone possessive pronoun, or it can fill the possessor position in a nominal phrase, as in <example>whose toys</example>.</introduction>
		<instruction id="QContInstruction">In the lexicon, mark all of the interrogative words or affixes with the feature <feature>wh</feature>.  Also, add the feature <feature>makeQ</feature> to the word meaning ‘how many / how much’ so that it will be treated as a quantifier.
<br/>
            <br/>
			<span id="QContWhichDemInstruction" show="swDemPresent">In addition, make sure that your word meaning ‘which’ either already has the category <category>Dem</category> or add the feature <feature>makeDem</feature> to the entry.</span>
			<span id="QContWhichArtInstruction" show="swArtOnlyPresent">In addition, since your language does not have any demonstratives, make sure that your word meaning ‘which’ either already has the category <category>Art</category> or add the feature <feature>makeArt</feature> to the entry.</span>
			<span id="QContWhichNoDetInstruction" show="swNoDetPresent">In addition, since your language does not have any demonstratives or articles, if you have a word meaning ‘which’, it will have to be treated as a possessor.  As such, it simply acts as a pronoun like the majority of the interrogative words, and the category mapping will be handled by the Category Mapper at the end of this section.  Add the case feature <span id="QContGenCaseSpan" show="swPossCaseGen"><feature>genitive</feature> to the entry to restrict its appearance to possessor position.</span><span id="QContAbsCaseSpan" show="swPossCaseAbs"><feature>absolutive</feature> to the entry to restrict the positions where it may appear.</span><span id="QContErgCaseSpan" show="swPossCaseErg"><feature>ergative</feature> to the entry to restrict the positions where it may appear.</span></span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
The word meaning ‘why’ needs to have the category <category>Adv</category> (or your morphological category for adverbs that you mapped to <category>Adv</category> in <section number="3">Adverbs and AdvP</section>) and the feature <feature>reason</feature>. <br/>
            <br/>
The word meaning ‘where’ needs to have the category <category>Adv</category> (or your morphological category for adverbs that you mapped to <category>Adv</category> in <section number="3">Adverbs and AdvP</section>) and the feature <feature>locative</feature>. <br/>
            <br/>
The word meaning ‘when’ needs to have two entries, if it can be used as both an interrogative word and as a temporal adverb which can take a sentential complement.  Both entries need to have the category <category>Adv</category> (or your morphological category for adverbs that you mapped to <category>Adv</category> in <section number="3">Adverbs and AdvP</section>) and the feature <feature>temporal</feature>.   Add the feature <feature>wh</feature> to one entry and the features <feature>sentential embedded_IP</feature> to the other entry.<br/>
            <br/>
			<span id="QContDegPresentSpan" show="swDegPresent">The word meaning ‘how’ needs to have two entries, one with the category <category>Adv</category> (or your morphological category for adverbs that you mapped to <category>Adv</category> in <section number="3">Adverbs and AdvP</section>) and the feature <feature>manner</feature> and another entry which can have any appropriate morphological category but has the features <feature>makeDeg modifies_Adj modifies_Q</feature>.</span>
			<span id="QContDegQOnlyPresentSpan" show="swDegQOnlyPresent">The word meaning ‘how’ needs to have two entries, one with the category <category>Adv</category> (or your morphological category for adverbs that you mapped to <category>Adv</category> in <section number="3">Adverbs and AdvP</section>) and the feature <feature>manner</feature> and another entry which can have any appropriate morphological category but has the features <feature>makeDeg modifies_Q</feature>.</span>
			<span id="QContDegAdjOnlyPresentSpan" show="swDegAdjOnlyPresent">The word meaning ‘how’ needs to have two entries, one with the category <category>Adv</category> (or your morphological category for adverbs that you mapped to <category>Adv</category> in <section number="3">Adverbs and AdvP</section>) and the feature <feature>manner</feature> and another entry which can have any appropriate morphological category but has the features <feature>makeDeg modifies_Adj</feature>.  Since your language does not have stand alone degree words that modify quantifiers, you may have another interrogative word meaning ‘how many’ and/or ‘how much’.  These words/phrases act like quantifiers, so the entry needs to have the features <feature>makeQ wh</feature>.</span>
			<span id="QContNoDegSpan" show="swNoDegPresent">The word meaning ‘how’ needs to have the category <category>Adv</category> (or your morphological category for adverbs that you mapped to <category>Adv</category> in <section number="3">Adverbs and AdvP</section>) and the feature <feature>manner</feature>.   Since your language does not have stand alone degree words that modify quantifiers, you may have another interrogative word meaning ‘how many’ and/or ‘how much’.  These words/phrases act like quantifiers, so the entry needs to have the features <feature>makeQ wh</feature>.</span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
			<span id="QContWhatDemInstruction" show="swDemPresent">The word meaning ‘what’ also needs two entries if it can modify a noun as in English.  This entry which allows it to modify a noun needs to have the category <category>Dem</category> or add the <feature>makeDem</feature> to the entry.<br/>
                <br/>
The normal pronoun use of the word meaning ‘what’ and the remainder of the interrogative words above need to be mapped to the category <category>Pron</category>.  This will be handled by the Category Mapper at the end of this section.
</span>
			<span id="QContWhatArtInstruction" show="swArtOnlyPresent">The word meaning ‘what’ also needs two entries if it can modify a noun as in English.  Since your language does not have any demonstratives, this entry which allows it to modify a noun needs to have the category <category>Art</category> or add the feature <feature>makeArt</feature> to the entry.<br/>
                <br/>
The normal pronoun use of the word meaning ‘what’ and the remainder of the interrogative words above need to be mapped to the category <category>Pron</category>.  This will be handled by the Category Mapper at the end of this section.
</span>
			<span id="QContWhatNoDetInstruction" show="swNoDetPresent">Since your language does not have any demonstratives or articles, the word meaning ‘what’ only needs one entry.  It simply acts as a pronoun like the majority of the interrogative words, and the category mapping to the category <category>Pron</category> will be handled by the Category Mapper at the end of this section.  Do not add any case features to the entry, so it will be allowed in possessor position as well as taking the place of a full nominal phrase.</span>
            <br/>
            <br/>
The word meaning ‘whose’ needs to have two entries, both with the category which will be mapped to the category <category>Pron</category> at the end of the section (and both with the feature <feature>wh</feature>).  One entry needs the feature <feature>possessive</feature> for the stand alone case and the other entry needs the case feature <span id="QContGenCaseSpan1" show="swPossCaseGen"><feature>genitive</feature> to restrict its appearance to possessor position.</span><span id="QContAbsCaseSpan1" show="swPossCaseAbs"><feature>absolutive</feature> to restrict the positions where it may appear.</span><span id="QContErgCaseSpan1" show="swPossCaseErg"><feature>ergative</feature> to restrict the positions where it may appear.</span>
