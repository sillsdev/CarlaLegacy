    <title>Complement Clauses</title>
	<introduction>This section considers various types of embedded clauses which are complements of main verbs or of adjectives which are functioning as the predicate of the sentence, such as the following examples from English. </introduction>
    <EnglishExample>
        <exItem label="1.">I believe that Jill is my friend.</exItem>
        <exItem label="2.">Jill insists that she is my friend.</exItem>
        <exItem label="3.">I expect that Joe will come to the party.</exItem>
        <exItem label="4.">I expect Joe to come to the party.</exItem>
        <exItem label="5.">I will persuade Joe that he should come to the party.</exItem>
        <exItem label="6.">I will persuade Joe to come to the party.</exItem>
        <exItem label="7.">Joe would hate for Sue to be at the party.</exItem>
        <exItem label="8.">Joe tried to come to the party.</exItem>
	   <exItem label="9.">John seemed to like the tortillas.</exItem>
	   <exItem label="10.">It seems likely that Joe will come.</exItem>
    </EnglishExample>
   <introduction>Causatives that consist of two clauses, as exemplified in 11-12, are also covered here. (Morphological causatives consisting of a single clause were discussed in <section number="9.8">Basic, Single-Clause Sentences - Causatives</section>.)</introduction>
   <EnglishExample>
	  <exItem label="11.">My mother made me clean my room.</exItem>
	  <exItem label="12.">The other girl caused us to break up.</exItem>
   </EnglishExample>
   <introduction>Direct and indirect speech, as shown in 13-14, are also complement clauses to be covered in this section.  However, embedded questions will be handled in <section number="11">Questions</section>.</introduction>
  <EnglishExample>
	 <exItem label="13.">Sue said, “I will come to your house tomorrow.”</exItem>
	 <exItem label="14."> Sue said that she would come here tomorrow.</exItem>
  </EnglishExample>
   <introduction id="CompIntroNotPractical" show="swNotPractical">The examples illustrate that the main verb selects one or more particular types of complement clauses which can occur gramatically.  For example, <example>try</example> cannot have a complement clause beginning with <example>that</example> and the subject of the embedded clause must be coreferent to the main clause subject and pro-dropped.  Further, <example>believe, insist</example> and <example>persuade</example> cannot have a complement clause beginning with <example>for</example> and none of the verbs above can have an embedded question complement.
<br/>
        <br/>
A second point the examples illustrate is that the presence of a particular complementizer determines the finiteness of the embedded verb which follows it.  This evidence of subcategorization by the main verb for the complementizer and by the complementizer for the embedded verb form leads to the conclusion that the complementizer is the head of the embedded clause.  Therefore, within X-Bar Theory, embedded clauses which have complementizers are CPs, which sit on top of the IP.
<br/>
        <br/>A sample tree for example 1 is shown here:
<tree img="TreeDescriptions/PawsCompCP.png"/>
        <br/>
When there is no complementizer present, as in examples 4, 6 and 8 above, the complement clause is simply an IP.  A sample tree for example 4 with a nonfinite complement is shown here:
<tree img="TreeDescriptions/PawsCompIPnonfinite.png"/>
<br/>
There is an important difference between <example>expect</example> (in examples 3 and 4) and <example>persuade</example> (in examples 5 and 6): <example>expect</example> can have either a finite CP or a nonfinite IP for its complement while <example>persuade</example> has a direct object as well as either of those complement clauses.  A tree for example 5 is shown here:
<tree img="TreeDescriptions/PawsCompDPCP.png"/>
<br/>
Next, a tree for example 8 with a nonfinite IP complement and required pro-drop is shown here:
<tree img="TreeDescriptions/PawsCompIPprodrop.png"/>
	  <br/>
	  Finally, verbs like <example>seem</example> ( including other perception verbs and copulas) are called ‘raising’ verbs, since <example>seem</example> doesn’t really have its own subject, and takes either a nonfinite sentence as a complement or an adjective which can have a finite sentence with a complementizer as its complement.  In the nonfinite case (9), the subject of the complement appears in the subject postion of <example>seem</example>.  In the finite complement case, there is no overt subject for <example>seem</example>, so a “dummy” word <example>it</example> fills that position in English.  Some languages simply leave the main clause subject postion empty.
 <br/><br/>     A tree for example 9 with a nonfinite IP complement and  coreferent subjects due to raising will look just like the tree for example 8 with <example>try</example>, since we are not modelling the null elements.  Similarly,
	  a tree for example 10 would be vey similar to the tree above for example 1 with <example>believe</example>, except for the adjective complement and the dummy <example>it</example> in the main clause subject position.
