		<instruction> You need to make sure the pronouns in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Pron</category> (which will then be mapped again appropriately to the positions they can occur in the tree structure).  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have pronouns marked with the category <category>Pron</category> in your lexicon, nothing
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If pronouns are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Pron</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makePron</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
				<li>If you have pronouns marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Pron</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Pron</category>. <br/>
