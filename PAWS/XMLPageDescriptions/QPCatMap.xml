		<instruction>You need to make sure the cardinal number words in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Num</category> (including the same capitalization).  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have numbers marked with the category <category>Num</category> in your lexicon, nothing
  more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If numbers are mixed in with another category in the lexicon (e.g. adjectives), you either need to give them the category <category>Num</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeNum</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
				<li>If you have numbers marked in your lexicon with a distinct category all their own, but it is different from <category>Num</category>, enter that category below so PAWS can map your morphological category to <category>Num</category>. <br/>

		You need to make sure the conjunctions in your lexicon will be mapped to the syntactic category <category>Conj</category>.  Choose one of the following options, depending on your situation:
<ul>
				<li>If you already have conjunctions marked with the category <category>Conj</category> in your lexicon, nothing more needs to be done.</li>
				<li>If conjunctions are mixed in with another category in the lexicon, you either need to give them the category <category>Conj</category> in your morphological parser, or add the feature <feature>makeConj</feature> to each appropriate entry in the lexicon so the category will be changed for the syntax.</li>
